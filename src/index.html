		<h3>Here is a little about me and my interests</h3>
		<p>I worked in education for 10 rewarding years, and somewhere along the way I found an intrinsic interest in technology. Since this discovery I’ve decided to pursue my passion and learn as much as I can about computer hardware and programming. I’ve built several computers and have begun learning several programming languages. This website will be home to my projects, ideas, and insight into what Zachary Stall is all about!</p>
